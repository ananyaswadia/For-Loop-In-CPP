## Theory 
In C++, for loop is an entry-controlled loop that is used to execute a block of code repeatedly for the given number of times. It is generally preferred over while and do-while loops in case the number of iterations is known beforehand.

### Syntax 
Initialization: Initialize the loop variable to some initial value.
Test Condition: This specifies the test condition. If the condition evaluates to true, then body of the loop is executed, and loop variable is updated according to update expression. If evaluated false, loop is terminated.
Update Expression: After executing the loop body, this expression increments/decrements the loop variable by some value.

### Working of a for Loop in C++
The working of for loop is as shown below:

Initialization: Control enters the loop, and initialization is done.
Condition Check: The condition is tested.
If true, the flow enters the loop body.
If false, the loop terminates, and control exits the loop.
Execution of Body: The statements inside the body of the loop are executed.
Update: The loop variable is updated.
Repeat: The flow returns to Step 2 (Condition Check) for the next iteration.
Exit: Once the condition becomes false, the loop terminates, and control exits the loop.

## Conclusion
We learnt to implement the 'FOR' loop using different star patterns, and programs like password setting to gain a clear understanding.
